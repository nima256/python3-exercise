# for loop 
# lets write code that we think here is a school and we need.. 
# .. name , last name , age , serial number 
# its enough

# i make variable to save particulars that user enter
# maybe you have question to why i make to variable for each other?
# if you want to know go in my what-i-have-to-do- repository and read for.py 
# i explain it if you cant okay i bring it here

# "when you print your variable that in it you ask user to ..
# .. enter number it only give you last number that user enter it"

# here you are
